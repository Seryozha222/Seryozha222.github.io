    <p class="Merc">The Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class,  formerly Mercedes-Benz M-Class, is a mid-size luxury <br> SUV produced by the German automaker Mercedes-Benz since 1997. In terms <br> of size, it is slotted in between the <br> smaller GLC-Class (based on the C-Class) and the larger GLS-Class, the <br> latter with which it shares platforms.
    
        For a short time, between 1999 and 2002, the M-Class was also built by Magna Steyr <br> in Graz, Austria, for the European market, before all production moved <br> to the U.S. plant near Vance, Alabama. <br> From late 2012, the M-Class was also assembled at new plants in India, <br> Indonesia, and Thailand.
        
        Since April 2015, the M-Class has been renamed to the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class.</p>
